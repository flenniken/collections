  "description": "We reserved a house that sleeps 10 and allowed dogs, intended for Adie and Anna's dog.  It turned out they found a new home for the dog, so we didn't need that.  The house wasn't up to our usual standards but we got used to it. Elisabeth's friend Abby was able to vacation with us.  Later in the week Doug, Adie, Anna, Jaclyn, Garret and the baby Sadie all arrived.",
