  "description": "The Pantheon made a big impression on me. What struck me most was its beauty and how well it has survived for nearly two thousand years.\n\nI started thinking about modern building techniques and what it would take to create something that could last that long.\n\nThe Colosseum was looted for stone and metal, so building mainly with concrete seems wise. Instead of iron rebar, we could use carbon-fiber reinforcement—it lasts longer and has little value to looters.\n\nInside, the design could feature beautiful colors and tiles, but not valuable materials that are easy to remove. The building should function even without electricity or running water. The Pantheon’s oculus provides light when electric systems fail; similarly, a modern version could use natural light and low-power LEDs when power is available. Modern heating could be included, but we should also consider how to keep the building comfortable when power is lost—perhaps this kind of structure is best suited to warmer climates.\n\nThe Pantheon’s survival also owes much to its conversion into a church. Because it remained in continuous use, it was maintained over the centuries.\n\nIts size and beauty are another reason people have preserved it—citizens are proud of it and don’t want to see it destroyed. A modern equivalent, I think, would be a public space such as a theater, concert hall, or town meeting venue. With good acoustics and a modest stage, it could host many types of gatherings—a place where people enjoy coming together and feel civic pride.\n\nSuch a building should be located in a populated city where people can walk to it, but not in an area so valuable that developers would want to replace it with high-rises.\n\nThere could be small caretaker rooms built into the structure and large doors to secure it in times of trouble. And, like the Pantheon, it should have a public square in front—a gathering space that adds to its sense of importance and permanence.",
