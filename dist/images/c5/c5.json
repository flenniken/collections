The park is threaded with small freshwater ditches filled with familiar aquarium fish like swordtails, guppies, and orange platies, just like the ones I had growing up. Families were barbecuing, chickens wandered freely, and the landscape was lush with full-size Cook pines, a sprawling banyan tree, and clusters of bananas.",
