// Service worker code.

// https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers:
//
// Service workers get updated when the browser detects that the
// service worker currently controlling the client and the new (from
// your server) version of the same file are byte-different.
//
// The user needs to close or navigate away from all tabs and windows
// using the current service worker and then navigate back. Only then
// will the new service worker take control.
//
// If not already running, a service worker will start whenever a
// network request in its scope is asked for, or when a triggering
// event, like periodic background sync or a push message, is
// received.

// todo: I would like one copy of this.  See image-folder.json.
const cacheUrlPrefix = "/collections-images/"
