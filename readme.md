# Flenniken.net Collections

Collections is a progressive web app (PWA) for viewing curated
collections of photos.

A PWA runs in a browser but looks a lot like a native app.

Each collection is a small set of related photos, for example photos
of a trip to Many Glaciers Lodge.

You navigate and view images on three types of pages, the index page,
a thumbnails page, and an image page.

# Index Page

The index page shows the list of available collections with the most
recent collection on top.

There is a thumbnail for each collection and descriptive text.  The
text contains a title, description and post date.

You can scroll through the list and the most recent collections are
shown. When you reach the bottom of the list, there is a more
indicator.

Clicking on a collection switches to the thumbnails page.

# Thumbnails Page

The thumbnails page shows the collection’s thumbnails.

There are only a few images in a collection. This has benefits that
the users see the best photos and it puts more focus on the story
provided by the descriptions. It’s also easier to build well.

Past the bottom of the thumbnails you see the collection title and
description and an optional map showing the location of where the
photos were taken.

Scrolling down and holding goes back to the collection index Page.

Clicking on a thumbnail shows the full size photo on the image page.

# Image Page

The image page shows one image at a time.  The image is custom zoomed
(a zoom point) to fit the screen showing the best view for the screen
orientation and size.

You can zoom and pan an image.

You scroll up to see a description about the image.

You scroll left and right go to the previous and next images in the
collection. The next and previous images line up pixel perfect side by
side.  This is good for multi-images that look like one wide image.

You go back to the thumbnails page by scrolling down and holding.

# Install Collections

Since Collections is a PWA you can install the app on your iphone's
home screen. Clicking the app's icon runs it.

You can also run it from a URL in a browser but this is not
recommended. For the best experience run it from the installed
icon. You get a full screen experience and this is the tested path so
it works better.

You install the app’s icon on your home screen following these steps:

* launch safari on iphone (it doesn't install on chrome or firefox)
* go to:

https://flenniken.net/collections/index.html

* click on the share icon at the bottom center of the screen
* scroll up and select “Add to Home screen”, and click add

# Run Collections

To run the app you click the desktop icon.
